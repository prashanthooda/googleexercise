# A. donuts
# Given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string
# of the form 'Number of donuts: <count>', where <count> is the number
# passed in. However, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'
# instead of the actual count.
# So donuts(5) returns 'Number of donuts: 5'
# and donuts(23) returns 'Number of donuts: many'


def donuts(count):
    if count < 10:
        return 'Number of donuts: ' + str(count)
    else:
        return 'Number of donuts: many'


# B. both_ends
# Given a string s, return a string made of the first 2
# and the last 2 chars of the original string,
# so 'spring' yields 'spng'. However, if the string length
# is less than 2, return instead the empty string.

def both_ends(s):
     if len(s) < 2:
        return ''
     else:
        start= s[0:2]
        end = s[-2:]
        return start + end
     return 


# C. fix_start
# Given a string s, return a string
# where all occurences of its first char have
# been changed to '*', except do not change
# the first char itself.
# e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
# Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
# Hint: s.replace(stra, strb) returns a version of string s
# where all instances of stra have been replaced by strb.


def fix_start(s):
            start = s[0]
            end = s[1:]
            s=end.replace(s[0],'*')
            return start+s 

# D. MixUp
# Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated
# by a space '<a> <b>', except swap the first 2 chars of each string.
# e.g.
#   'mix', pod' -> 'pox mid'
#   'dog', 'dinner' -> 'dig donner'
# Assume a and b are length 2 or more.


def mix_up(a, b):
    start_a = a[0]
    start_b = b[0] 
    new_a = a.replace(a[0],b[0])
    new_b = b.replace(b[0],a[0])  
    return new_a + ' ' + new_b
